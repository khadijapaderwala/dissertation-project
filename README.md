# Description
Between 2015 and 2050 the proportion of the world’s population over 60 will
nearly double from 12% to 22%. With an aging population comes the increased risk of
neurodegenerative diseases, a group of disorders effecting neurons in the brain resulting in
their progressive atrophy. Despite years of research, a cure is yet to be found, highlighting the
importance of continued research of therapeutic options. This can only be achieved by
understanding the implicated genes and pathways that can be targeted with treatment. Many
neurodegenerative diseases share similarities in risk factors, genetic determinants, symptoms,
pathology and disease mechanisms, prompting the hypothesis that these diseases are different
manifestations of the same underlying disease and treatment for one may be able to treat
others.

This study aimed to identify overlapping dysfunctional genes and pathways across the
following diseases to determine potential drug targets: Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia, Huntington’s disease and
multiple sclerosis.
